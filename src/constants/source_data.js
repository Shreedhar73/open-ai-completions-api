Note that fuel cells (not electrolyzers) cannot use this full amount of heat/enthalpy, which has led to some confusion when calculating efficiency values for both types of technology. In the reaction, some energy is lost as heat. Some reports quote efficiencies between 50% and 70% for alkaline electrolyzers; however, much higher practical efficiencies are available with the use of [[Polymer_electrolyte_membrane_electrolysis|polymer electrolyte membrane electrolysis|181|wiki]] and catalytic technology, such as 95% efficiency."},{"block_type":"paragraph","content":"The [[National_Renewable_Energy_Laboratory|National Renewable Energy Laboratory|182|wiki]] estimated in 2006 that 1 kg of hydrogen (roughly equivalent to 3 kg, or 4 liters, of petroleum in energy terms) could be produced by wind powered electrolysis for between US$5.55 in the near term and US$2.27 in the longer term."},{"block_type":"paragraph","content":"About 4% of hydrogen gas produced worldwide is generated by electrolysis, and normally used onsite.

Direct electrolysis of seawater follows known processes, forming an electrolysis cell in which the seawater acts as the electrolyte to allow for the reaction at the [[Anode|anode|199|wiki]], and the reaction at the [[Cathode|cathode|200|wiki]],. The inclusion of [[Magnesium|magnesium|201|wiki]] and [[Calcium|calcium|202|wiki]] [[Ion|ions|203|wiki]] in the seawater makes the production of alkali [[Hydroxide|hydroxides|204|wiki]] possible that could form scales in the electrolyser cell, cutting down on lifespan and increasing the need for maintenance. The alkaline electrolyzers operate with the following reactions at the anode, and cathode,, and use high base solutions as electrolytes, operating at 60-90 C and need additional separators to ensure the gas phase hydrogen and oxygen remain separate. The electrolyte can easily get contaminated, but the alkaline electrolyser can operate under pressure to improve energy consumption. The electrodes can be made of inexpensive materials and there's no requirement for an expensive catalyst in the design. Proton-exchange membrane electrolyzers operate with the reactions at the anode, and cathode,, at temperatures of 60-80 C, using a solid polymer electrolyte and requiring higher costs of processing to allow the solid electrolyte to touch uniformly to the electrodes. Similar to the alkaline electrolyzer, the proton exchange membrane electrolyser can operate at higher pressures, reducing the energy costs required to compress the hydrogen gas afterward, but the proton exchange membrane  electrolyser also benefits from rapid response times to changes in power requirements or demands and not needing maintenance, at the cost of having a faster inherent degradation rate and being the most vulnerable to impurities in the water. Solid oxide electrolyzers run the reactions at the anode and at the cathode.The solid oxide electrolyzers require high temperatures (700-1000 C) to operate, generating superheated steam. They suffer from degradation when turned off, making it a more inflexible hydrogen generation technology. In a selected series of [[Multiple-criteria_decision_analysis|multiple-criteria decision-analysis|205|wiki]] comparisons in which the highest priority was placed on economic operation costs followed equally by environmental and social criteria, it was found that the proton exchange membrane electrolyser offered the most suitable combination of values (e.g., investment cost, maintenance, and operation cost, resistance to impurities, specific energy for hydrogen production at sea, risk of environmental impact, etc.), followed by the alkaline electrolyzer, with the alkaline  electrolyser being the most economically feasible, but more hazardous in terms of safety and environmental concerns due to the need for basic electrolyte solutions as opposed to the solid polymers used in proton-exchange membranes. Due to the methods conducted in multiple-criteria decision analysis, non-objective weights are applied to the various factors, and so multiple methods of decision analysis were performed simultaneously to examine the electrolyzers in a way that minimizes the effects of bias on the performance conclusions."}]}]},{"block_type":"heading","content":"See also","heading_level":1,"children":[{"block_type":"paragraph","content":""},{"block_type":"list","list_type":"ordered","content":[{"block_type":"list_item","content":"[[Alkaline_water_electrolysis|Alkaline water electrolysis|206|wiki]]"},{"block_type":"list_item","content":"[[Castner–Kellner_process|Castner–Kellner process|207|wiki]]"},{"block_type":"list_item","content":"[[Electrolytic_cell|Electrolytic cell|208|wiki]]"},{"block_type":"list_item","content":"[[Electrochemical_engineering|Electrochemical engineering|209|wiki]]"},{"block_type":"list_item","content":"[[Faraday's_law_of_electrolysis|Faraday's law of electrolysis|210|wiki]]"},{"block_type":"list_item","content":"[[Faraday_constant|Faraday constant|211|wiki]]"},{"block_type":"list_item","content":"[[Faraday_efficiency|Faraday efficiency|212|wiki]]"},{"block_type":"list_item","content":"[[Galvanic_corrosion|Galvanic corrosion|213|wiki]]"},{"block_type":"list_item","content":"[[Galvanoluminescence|Galvanoluminescence|214|wiki]]"},{"block_type":"list_item","content":"[[Gas_cracker|Gas cracker|215|wiki]]"},{"block_type":"list_item","content":"[[Hall–Héroult_process|Hall–Héroult process|216|wiki]]"},{"block_type":"list_item","content":"[[High-pressure_electrolysis|High-pressure electrolysis|217|wiki]]"},{"block_type":"list_item","content":"[[Overpotential|Overpotential|218|wiki]]"},{"block_type":"list_item","content":"[[Patterson_Power_Cell|Patterson Power Cell|219|wiki]]"},{"block_type":"list_item","content":"[[Thermochemical_cycle|Thermochemical cycle|220|wiki]]"},{"block_type":"list_item","content":"[[Timeline_of_hydrogen_technologies|Timeline of hydrogen technologies|221|wiki]]"},{"block_type":"list_item","content":"[[PEM_electrolysis|PEM electrolysis|222|wiki]]"}]}]},{"block_type":"heading","content":"References","heading_level":1,"children":[]}]
